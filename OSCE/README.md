# Cracking the Perimeter & OSCE Certification

```
Whatâ€™s after OSCP, why not OSCE?!
```

I started my study plan using 3 main resources, the only experience I had prior was OSCP and what was mentioned in my PWK/OSCP review.

#### 4 months out:

- First resource was Tulpa's OSCE prep guide. This has 17 lessons which build upon themselves and covers the topics in the course syllabus. It also has you going to other websites like fuzzsecurity, corelan, securitysift, pentester academy's x86 assembly (also known as SLAE). 
  - https://tulpa-security.com/2017/07/18/288/

- Next was abatchy's OSCE study plan. Some of the material is a repeat from Tulpa, however there is new content. For any broken links use https://www.archive.org.

- Finally, I downloaded vulnserver and threw it on an Windows 7 SP1 VM with Immunity. The 4 blogs below are useful for using boofuzz and if you get stuck or want to see how someone else writes an exploit for ideas.

  - https://stacktrac3.co/vulnserver-write-up/

#### 1 week out:

- I decided to use my PWK VM for CTP, also had the recommended BT5 Offsec provides saved just in case. I read that the course is doable with the PWK VM, however you will have to fix a few things as you go through the course.
